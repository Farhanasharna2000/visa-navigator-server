# VisaZen Server-Side   

This project is built using **Node.js** and **Express** for the backend, with **MongoDB** as the database.  

## **Key Features**  

### **Efficient Backend Framework**  
- **Node.js**: Non-blocking, event-driven architecture ensures high performance and scalability.  
- **Express.js**: Lightweight and flexible for building RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic.  

### **Robust Database Integration**  
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database offering flexible schema design, ideal for managing dynamic and hierarchical data.  

### **Scalability**  
- Horizontal scalability for managing increasing loads.  
- MongoDBâ€™s sharding and replication features ensure high availability.  


### **RESTful API Design**  
- Clean and structured API endpoints to simplify client-server communication.  
- Proper error handling and response standardization (e.g., HTTP status codes).  

### **Middleware Architecture**  
- Modular middleware to handle tasks like logging, authentication, and error handling.  

### **Environment Management**  
- Environment variables managed securely using packages like **dotenv**.  

### **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**  
- Configured to allow safe communication between the server and external client applications.  

### **Development-Friendly Features**  
- Hot-reloading with **Nodemon** for efficient development cycles.  
- Well-documented codebase for ease of maintenance and scaling.
